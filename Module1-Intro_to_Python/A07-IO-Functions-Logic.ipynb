    "In this lesson we will learn how to read data from files, write data to files, write new functions and use logic.  One of the most important tasks in data analytics is the ability to read data files into your Python scripts and to write files with results or reformatted data.  The process of reading and writing files is also referred to as File Input/Output or File IO.  Next, functions are a critical component of all modern programming languages. They provide several benefits.  They help you to simplify your programs and encapsulate commonly used code into reusable bits of code. Lastly, programs must be able to make decisions and logic is key to programming decision making."

    "Python provides a built-in function named `open()` that allows you to open a file either for reading or writing. We will learn to use it to do both.  There are two types of files that Python can open: plain **text** files and **binary** files.  A text file contains human-readable text.  It may have some special encodings, which we will learn about, but in general you can open it with any text editor and read it.  A binary file is one where the contents are machine-readable. The language of the computer is 1's and 0's (binary). These files store information in patterns of 1's and 0's that are not legible by a human. If you open one with a text editor you will often see a series of illegible characters. Text and binary files can store the same information but binary files can be organized to access data more quickly and store data more compactly.  In data analytics, many data files are plain text files, often in tab-delimited, or comma-separated formats.  In this lesson, we will learn read and write text files only. Binary files are more complicated and if you see a binary file that needs reading there is often a Python library with functions that you can use to read the file for you."

    "We learned to get access to a file we need to first use the `open()` function.  By default, the `open()` function will *only* open the file for reading. It will not allow us to write to the file.  We need to provide a second argument to tell Python to give us access to write to the file.  This second argument is called **mode**. To open a file for writing we need need to set the mode to the string `\"w\"`. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Open the file for writing.\n",
    "my_file = open(\"~/my_data.csv\", \"w\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice, in the instruction above, the second argument to the `open` function is the string `\"w\"`. This tells Python to open the file for writing.   The `\"w\"`, or \"write\", mode will also create the file if it does not exist.  This is convenient because we do not have to precreate the file.  But, what if the file already exsits? If we use the `\"w\"` mode and the file exists then the file will be opend for writing but all existing contents will be removed. The file will become empty and the file handle will be set at the beginning of the file, ready for us to add new content.  If the file exists and we do not want to erase the contents we can use the `\"a\"` mode (for \"append\").  The `\"a\"` mode will open the file for writing, it will not empty the file contents, and it will set the file handle at the end of the file. Once the file is opened and ready for writing, then there are two ways we can write to a file: using the `write()` method of the file object or, using the `print()` function."

The language of computers is 1's and 0's and these 1's and 0's can be combined to form numbers.  Thus, the ASCII encoding used numbers to represent characters in the English language. For example, the character \"A\" was encoding using the number 65. A \"B\" was encoded using the number 66, etc. A lowercase \"a\" was encoding using the number 97, \"b\" as 98 and so forth.  The ASCII encoding is still used today, but it cannot be used for languages other than English, it can only represent 128 characters and those 128 numbers are already accounted for. \n",

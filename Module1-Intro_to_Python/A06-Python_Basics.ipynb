    "People tend to use Python in two different ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Writing stand-alone programs, software packages or libraries of code for sharing with others.\n",
    "2. Scripting for data analysis in a Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first module of this course, we will learn the basics Python code for either of these types of programming. We will also learn to run your code as if it were a stand-alone program. Scientific software that is meant to be shared with others is often written as stand-alone programs.  Later, in the second module, we will peform Python progamming using Jupyter Notebooks for data analytics.  "

    "## About Python\n",
    "Python is an interpreted programming language, meaning that each time you execute your code the Python interpreter reads you code and follows the instructions it contains.  You can then make changes, execute your code and see the results. In contrast, other programming languages such as C++ require that your code is converted into a binary format which is a self-contained program and no interpreter is required.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Python is one of the worlds most popular programming languages. It is versatile in that it can be used for software development, web programming and for data science due to many numerical, statistical, machine and deep learning libraries."

    "## Tips for Success\n",
    "As you learn to program Python with these lessons you can maximize your learning and retention by following these suggestions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* <i class=\"fas fa-clone\"></i> **Do not cut-and-paste**:  These lessons provide a lot of code examples. It's easy to cut-and-paste code into your program files.  But if you take the time to type out each line of code as you can remember it, you will be more likely to retain information.\n",
    "* <i class=\"fas fa-wrench\"></i> **Do each practice excercise**: Take the time to run each practice exercise provided in the lectures.\n",
    "* <i class=\"fas fa-clock\"></i> **Take time to understand**: When you code, every word, space and character and their placement has meaning.  The Python interpreter\n",
    "* <i class=\"fas fa-question-circle\"></i> **Ask for help**: Learning to programming can be hard and sometimes can eat away at our time when we encounter bugs or problems we do not know how to resolve. Some among us slog through that with the intention of either not wanting to bug others or wanting to do everything on our own.  Rather than take either of these attitudes, try your best to work through problems on your own, but also try to recognize when you have spent too long.  There is no need to waste your own time when there is help available. Be sure, though, to avoid the other extreme of asking for help immediatly when a problem arises as you need to invest time developing your own problem solving skills.\n",
    "* <i class=\"fas fa-users\"></i> **Do not compare yourself**: Each student learns to program at different rates.  Some students will fly through lessons and exercises quickly while others take a lot longer.  Resist the urge to compare your own progress and speed with that of others. We all come at programming with different backgrounds and different ways of approaching problems. Some of us have to rewire how we think to match more how a computer performs.  Accept yourself for where you are, work hard and do your best."

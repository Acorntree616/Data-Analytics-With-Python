    "## What is JupyterLab?\n",
    "JupyterLab is a \"web-based, interactive development environment\" that allows you to write code, display data, and to interleave code with written text.  For lab scientists you can treat a JupyterLab as a type of lab notebook for computing.  JupyterLab is most often used for data analytics, data science, and scientific computing.  We will use JupyterLab for these purposes as well as for training and teaching.  The official Jupyter website can be found here: [https://jupyter.org/](https://jupyter.org/). \n",
    "\n",
    "One benefits of Jupyter notebooks is that they can be rendered by sites like [GitHub](https://github.com) in a non-interactive form which is why you can read this now, on the web, but later you will be able to clone these notebooks and work with them interactively on your own computer.  JupyterLab and Jupyter notebooks are easy to use once software such as [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) is installed.  We will work with jupyter notebooks soon, but here is a quick tutorial. "

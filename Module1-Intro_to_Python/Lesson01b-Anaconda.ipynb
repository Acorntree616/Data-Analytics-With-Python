    "For this course we need to have the Python interpreter installed. Additionally, we will also use popular 3rd-party libraries that have been created for Python.  To make this easy we will use the software package Anaconda, which make it easy for us to manage Python on our local machines.  Instructions are provided below for three operating systems: Windows, OS X and Ubuntu.  Follow the instructions that match the machine you are using."
